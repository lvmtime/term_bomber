Text based "Mine sweeper" clone

This project was written while I was learning how to write programs for Linux.
It has been rotting on my hard drive since 2009 without the TODO list being
finished, and without ever being properly packaged for distribution.

Source files probably need cleaning too, maybe replacing tabs with spaces.

I wrote this whidth tab = 8 spaces in mind...

More about this on [my blog](https://levdev.wordpress.com/).

If you find any use for this whatsoever, I will be happy to [hear about it](mailto:lvmtime@gmail.com)!
